-: Design Your Blueprint for Success
At Udacity, we recommend you take a proactive approach to the job 
search process. By first building your self-confidence and clearly 
identifying your needs and wants, you’ll be in a better position to 
seek out jobs that will actually make a lasting impact on your future. 

You'll know what you want - and what you don't want - in a job. You 
can also better visualize your path to that job and make immediate 
plans. For example, perhaps your next job first requires more skills 
that you don’t yet have, and thus requires a few months of learning 
and practice.

A career-oriented self-reflection helps you make sure you're on the 
right track. The self-reflection builds your blueprint for success.

Q: Why did you choose to pursue a new career?

Suggestns:
"I realized that I’m not feeling fulfilled in my current career path and 
want to transition to a job that will challenge and excite me."

"I never thought of myself as someone who could successfully code and 
develop a mobile app, and I want to give myself that opportunity."

"I have a family that depends on me and I need a better job to continue 
to provide for them."

Q: What questions do you currently have about the tech industry?

Suggestns:
What does [industry term] mean?

Why is this technology used in this way?

Who invented a particular practice and how long has it been in use?

How can I make [this particular technology] better?

Q: What skills do you want to improve or develop?

Suggestns:
The benefit of constantly working on existing and new skills is that 
you will be accumulating a body of work which can be included in your 
portfolio to showcase to employers.

In order to know which new skills you should focus on developing, you 
must become familiar with the common skills that the role you're 
interested in typically requires.

Use your research of the role to guide your decisions on which skills 
to focus on sharpening next. Explore these potential job roles by 
conducting a simple Google search - you'll find blog posts, articles 
and other guides explaining more about the job.

Q: What are 2-3 personal values that matter to you above all? For example, 
a common one is "to help people."

Suggestns:
Each company has its own mission and values, which guide its business 
approach and company decisions. Identifying your own key values will 
help you look for companies where you will be able to do work that 
aligns with and reinforces these values.

"Years ago, I was looking for a new job and originally thought myself open 
to anything - any job, any field. My attempts to network were not fruitful 
- every conversation seemed so forced and awkward!

I realized that I didn't just want any job - I didn't have a clear idea 
of an exact role, but I knew I wanted to work in education and, in particular, 
help young students. I then started to find people on LinkedIn who worked in 
afterschool programs, school lunch services, and college prep non-profits. 
I reached out to them for informational interviews and got job leads on small 
organizations and companies.

These networking attempts were actually fruitful because I was interested 
and passionate, which resonated well with others and they were more 
willing to help me. One person added me to a private jobs mailing list, 
which is how I found my job!"

Q: What are your top preferences for a compatible work environment (geographic 
location, company size, employment type, etc)? The list can be as long as you'd 
like!

Suggestns:
Type of employment (do you want a full-time job or part-time/contract opportunity?)

Work day flexibility (for example, would you prefer a steady 9-5 or the ability to 
work your own hours so long as you get the work done?)

Benefits (how much do things such as healthcare, stocks or equity, and vacation 
days matter to you?)

Job growth opportunities (how do you want the company to support you in your 
career development?)

Perks (how much do things like foosball tables, company-sponsored lunches, and 
happy hours matter to you?)


-: Separate Your Job Desires and Job Needs
Identifying your "must-haves" and "nice-to-haves" will help you determine which 
things are job desires and which are job needs.

Consider this example:
Jenny loves to travel regularly, and REMOTE work is required for her to keep 
her lifestyle. Working in environmental sustainability would be nice to have, 
but she's open to ANY GOOD JOB that allows her to telecommute.
To Jenny, the ability to travel is the most important thing for her, since 
her passion in life is meeting new people and exploring new places. She's 
always been interested in environmental sustainability, but there are also 
other rewarding fields out there in education, healthcare, and services. 
She's open to any remote roles in those industries.


To Clara, it is a necessity that her job be about working on ENVIRONMTAL 
SUSTAINABILITY. For her, a nice-to-have is the option to work remotely, but 
she wouldn't mind working somewhere that didn't provide this option.
To Clara, environmental sustainability is a "must-have" because it's her 
passion in life and where she wants to make her mark. Even if she got an 
amazing job in another field, she wouldn't be as happy working for a company 
whose mission didn't align with hers. However, although it would be nice to 
work remotely, she's willing to come into the office every day or even move 
cities for a chance to follow her passion.

-: Map Your Career Journey

Map Your Career Journey through Online Research
You have already identified what you want out of a career, both professionally 
and personally. Now it’s time to find the places that can help you meet those 
goals! In the exercise below, you will create a list of companies that interest 
you. Don’t be afraid to do some exploring outside of your industries as 
well—there are many tech jobs in traditionally non-tech sectors.

The goal of this exercise is to determine the next stop on your career path - 
likely a new job or role. With that stop in mind, you can map your journey 
with what to study next and specific skills to develop for that next job.

Tip: Don’t forget that this process will be a marathon, not a sprint. Explore 
careers and new industries with persistent curiosity. Be sure to keep your 
notebook next to you so you can write new questions as they come up.

We performed a search for you on LinkedIn, and you can see the results when 
you click on the link below. We searched for "developer" jobs worldwide on 
LinkedIn.
https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?keywords=developer&location=Worldwide&locationId=OTHERS.worldwide

While browsing on LinkedIn, identify 2-3 locations you'd like to work in and 
find three companies hiring in those locations. The information you collect 
should reflect why you're interested in the company, what makes them a good 
fit for you, and any basic information you should know as an applicant.

For example, imagine that you are interested in companies located in Mountain 
View, and decide to do more research on one called Udacity. The notes you take 
should look something like this:

Primary Product(s)
Nanodegree programs
Free, single courses
Udacity Connect
Corporate training

History of the company or organization
Founded in 2011 by David Stavens, Mike Sokolsky, Sebastian Thrun
Udacity originally focused on offering university-style courses, but in 2015, 
Udacity started the Nanodegree program, a paid credential program which is 
its main product today.

Company Mission
Democratize education by offering world-class higher education opportunities 
that are accessible, flexible, and economical.
"Virtually anyone on the planet with an internet connection and a commitment 
to self-empowerment through learning can come to Udacity, master a suite of 
job-ready skills, and pursue rewarding employment."

Leadership
CEO: Vish Makhijani
President: Sebastian Thrun
VP, Careers: Kathleen Mullaney (I'm interested in working on career development)
Knowing the company's leadership, you can search for talks, blog posts, or 
articles about them. This will give you insight on their interests, goals for 
Udacity, and background information that can be talking points when you discuss 
Udacity.

Why do you want to work here?
The mission aligns with my own belief that lifelong learning is important.
I see many jobs are remote-friendly and I like that flexibility.
I'm interested in gaining experience in the online learning space.

What Next?
You can dig in a little bit on sites like Glassdoor, which allows employees 
and interviewees to post information about their experiences anonymously.
https://www.glassdoor.com/index.html

Get to Know a Company's Product
You've taken a quick snapshot of three companies. If one or more of them 
interest you further, your next step is to better understand their products.

We cannot stress enough how important it is to have an understanding of a 
company’s product when you decide to apply for a job. If the product is 
free to acquire (for example, an app that you can download and test out), 
use it for a few days and take notes on what your user experience is like. 
If you cannot pay for the product, or the product is inaccessible to you, 
search for reviews online and see what people who have used it have written. 
Here are a couple of things to watch out for that will help you understand 
the product’s role in the current market:
    How many users does it currently have? 
    Where does it rank against its competitors?
    Have any major publications (The New York Times, Bloomberg Business, Wired, etc.) 
    covered the product or company’s growth and development?
    Are there any major glitches, bugs, or other technical flaws that have been 
    reported and have gone unresolved?
    In your opinion, what are the best attributes of the product? 
    What are things to be fixed or improved?

By learning the most up-to-date information on a company's product, you will be 
able to speak more eloquently in an interview or to a company contact, showcasing 
your in-depth knowledge of the company.

The Next Step in Career Exploration - Informational Interviews
Career and industry research will also involve reaching out to new connections 
in order to learn more granular information about a particular position in a 
company. If you don't have a concrete idea of which jobs you're interested in, 
informational interviews are even more helpful in giving you valuable, insider 
insight.

================================
-: Conduct an Informational Interview
What is an informational interview?
After performing your own career and industry research, the natural progression 
of building upon this knowledge is talking to people, in order to learn from them. 
Usually, an informational interview is a one-on-one informal meeting, phone call 
or video conference where you lead a conversation with someone who is currently 
working in a role, company, or industry you are interested in.

Why is it useful?
Being able to speak with those already working in the industry will allow you to 
confirm or refute the information you've collected on your own. It is an opportunity 
for you to learn about company culture, responsibilities of a role from an internal 
perspective, industry prospects, or even open positions at the company. Informational 
interviews are also a great way to make new professional connections and expand your 
network, whether you’re currently active on the job market or not.

==============================
-: How to Request an Informational Interview
How to Reach Out
There are numerous avenues to reach out to people. You can do a search on LinkedIn 
and message a few people with interesting backgrounds or current jobs. Or, you 
can attend a public networking event and ask someone you meet there.

Leverage your existing network.
Friends, former supervisors, colleagues, family, and alumni groups are all 
communities filled with people who have your best interest at heart. If you've 
enrolled in a Nanodegree program, you are already a part of a robust community 
of driven, supportive people - your Nanodegree community!

Asking your community at large is the easiest way to get information. Sometimes, 
you don't even need to ask a specific person; you can post a message like this 
on your social media profile:

“Hey! I am currently in the process of transitioning into [x field] and would 
love to talk to any [y roles or employees at z company] to gain a better 
understanding of the work and industry. Please send me a direct message, and 
I’ll be happy to buy you coffee!”

Target meetups, career fairs, public events, and LinkedIn.
Industry professionals are often interested in maintaining an active network 
and mentoring new talent. While each individual may have their own style and 
time constraints, being proactive and letting others know you are both 
interested and dedicated can yield great conversations and future contacts.

Target companies and roles separately.
Consider this example: if you are seeking out a product manager position but 
your only contact at your dream company is someone in Sales, you can still 
take the opportunity to learn more about the company culture and vision. 
They may also be able to provide an introduction to a product manager within 
the company. On the other hand, speaking with a product manager at a company 
or in an industry outside of your immediate interests can also be worthwhile 
as a way to learn about the role’s professional responsibilities.

Request an Informational Interview
An initial email or longer LinkedIn message are two of the most common ways 
of extending a request for an informational interview. Consider the following 
when crafting your message:
    Your tone should be gracious; at no point should you assume that they are 
    obligated to offer you their time or attention, regardless of how you know 
    each other.
    Make sure that your email is concise and specific. For example, if you're 
    hoping for a 20-minute phone call, you can say: "If you have time for a 
    20-minute phone call, I would appreciate the opportunity to learn more 
    about the company."
    Sometimes, you will not get an immediate reply. The person could be on 
    vacation or overwhelmed with messages.
        Be sure to allow enough time (up to 2 weeks) for a response. If 
        they have not responded within a week, you can send one follow-up 
        inquiry.

If you aren’t able to schedule a live conversation, the contact may be 
still willing to answer some questions over email or LinkedIn.

=====================
-: Ways to Connect
Now you know how to reach out to someone for an informational interview! The 
two most likely ways for you to connect with someone is over email (you got 
their business card, or someone introduced you both) or over LinkedIn. 
Although email and LinkedIn are different platforms, the structure of how 
you reach out and start a conversation is the same. See the examples below.

Sample Email Template:
Hi [Contact Name],

1st Paragraph - Self introduction including the following information:
Your career interests
Reason for reaching out
How contact’s position/background connects the first 2 pieces of information
Your connection to the person you’re writing to, if there is any

2nd Paragraph - Details on where, when, and how you would like to carry out 
the informational interview

Sincerely,

[Name]

transitioning into course development in the e-learning industry. i would

-------
Response:
Once they've accepted your invitation to connect, you can move forward 
with sending your request to meet for an informational interview.

Hey Ruyi, thanks for connecting and telling me a bit about yourself. I'm 
happy to chat. What would u like to learn about udacity?

e-learning company to create engaging courses.

would be happy to take u out for a coffee and hear about ur experience

Don't forget: people like being reached out to! There's no reason to see 
your informational interview request as an inconvenience to the other person. 
Like you, other people are interested in improving professionally, which can 
revolve around sharing their own experiences and knowledge or discussing 
current topics of interest in the industry.


==================
-: Ask Good Questions:
Below are a few guidelines:
Come prepared with smart, relevant questions. If you can find the answer to 
your question on the person's LinkedIn profile, in a Google search, or on 
the company website, you can be fairly confident that it won’t be the best 
question to ask.

Opt for open-ended questions with potential for insightful answers.
Before the interview, create a sample question list.
During the interview, take notes on the information you learn and be mindful 
of your goals.
Ask clarifying questions as needed.

Goals
Be goal-oriented throughout the interview. Think of a few outcomes you would 
like to achieve at the end of the interview. For example, your goal may be 
to build your network, find more contacts, or access insider information 
about company and culture.

We also recommend approaching the interview as an opportunity to gain 
recommendations for resources (blogs, books, etc.) relevant to your industry.

Finally, make it a goal to leave a positive impression. Even if your new 
contact isn’t able to directly help you advance in your job search right 
now, you never know when they may think of you for a future opportunity.

Q: Do you know which questions are a good idea to ask or are unsuitable 
to bring up in an informational interview? Take this quiz to find out. 
From this list, check all questions which you think would be good to ask.

Do you have any advice 4 sm1 lking to enter d field?

What oda careers did u consider?

What r u doing to keep ur skills up-to-date?

How do u approach professnal develpmt in ds field?

-: Debrief: Sample Questions Quiz
Can you tell me about [x company controversy]?

Why not to ask: As an employee, it can be both uncomfortable and awkward 
for them to make public comments to you about such a sensitive topic. 
The purpose of this informational interview is for you to develop a 
rapport with a valuable professional connection.

What to ask instead: Rather than focusing on such a negative topic, 
steer the conversation toward your shared passions and professional 
interests. If it's absolutely necessary for you to address an area 
of concern, do so in a polite and constructive way by posing the 
question after you have developed a stronger rapport with them. 
For example, instead of framing the conversation as company gossip, 
approach the question from a more professional angle: "After doing 
research on your company, I noticed some comments on Glassdoor about 
[x issue]. Would you be able to shed some light on my concerns regarding 
these comments?"

------------
How much do you make?
Why not to ask: It’s normal to be curious about such a topic, especially 
since you will have your own expectations around the salary for a position 
you're interested in. However, this can be an inappropriate, private 
question to ask, especially the first time you meet.

What to ask instead: If you wish to collect information on this topic, 
try posing a more general question to gauge the industry’s expected 
salary range for a position. Furthermore, don't forget to do some 
research on websites like Paysa, which provides market salary data, 
to see if you can find a reliable answer on your own.
https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/paysa

---------------
Can I add you on Facebook?
Why not to ask: You may find yourself developing a great connection with 
whomever you’re interviewing, but remember that you should keep the 
exchange professional. Furthermore, they may be hesitant about 
connecting on a social platform with someone who contacted them 
with inquiries about their professional experience and career advice.

What to ask instead: If you’d like to maintain friendly but 
professional contact with them, politely ask if you can add 
them on LinkedIn (if you haven’t already).

-------------------
What other roles have you worked in?
Why not to ask: This seems like a suitable question, but should 
actually be avoided because you should already know the answer! 
As part of your interview preparation, you’ll inevitably look up 
information on the interviewee’s work history via their LinkedIn 
profile. Remember, you want to spend the precious amount of time 
you have for this interview on getting answers to questions that 
you would not be able to find online.

What to ask instead: If you wish to learn more about a certain 
aspect of their work experience, try preparing questions that 
show you've done your research and have put much thought into 
what you want to discuss with them. For example, "I see you've 
worked at [this company]. Why did you decide to switch jobs?"

==========================
-: Keep the Conversation Going
How to Keep the Conversation Going
Now that you’ve made a personal connection, keep it going! Send a 
thank you note within 24 hours; email is fine! If anything particularly 
memorable happened during your conversation, you may want to mention 
it in order to reinforce that you were actively listening and engaged.

When sending your thank you email, send your resume so they can 
introduce you to others and remember who you are. Over time, keep 
in touch through holiday greetings, sharing information about 
topics of interest, and keeping them posted on progress in your 
job search. People like to help others and hear that they are 
making a positive impact!

Get out of your comfort zone and learn to be proactive about asking. 
The worst that can happen is that someone declines or does not 
respond to your request. But there will be people who don't decline 
and will respond!

Be optimistic and resourceful. Informational interviews are great 
learning experiences and practice for future job interviews.
